**This repository contains the summary notes created from the articles I read.** 

The markdown file was converted to PDF using `pandoc`. For example, 

```pandoc kennicutt1998_summary.md -o kennicutt1998_summary.pdf```

This is necessary to view the LaTeX-style formulas in the markdown file, since Github themselves do not render it.
